Business Card
# In this Assingment, we're going to create a Buisness Card by indentifying different logical sections of the app and draw boundaries around them.
# This requires two different sections: Logo, name, title and contact information. 
# We must understand that each section contains one composable component since we already know Image, Text, Column, Row and Icon composables are related to the Color Class.
# Both, the Row and Column composables must have both HorizontalArrangement and VerticalAlignment because they need to match my design i currently have. 
# The Image composables have the contentDescription parameter because the Image is only used for decorative purposes and it pushes out contentDescription parameter to null. 
# We can also customize the size by specifying both the width and height parameters to used modifiers in that same parameter. 
# Icon composables use the Tint with the Image to fill in the contentDescription parameter. 
# Text composables use fontSize, textAlign, color and fontWeight to style your text.
# As for Spacing and alignment, i can used modifier arguments such as padding and weight monitors to Space out composables. 
# Finally, i can use the color class to change my hex colors as different vues.
