Business Card
# In this Assingment, we're going to create a Buisness Card by indentifying different logical sections of the app and draw boundaries around them.
# This requires two different sections: Logo, name, title and contact information. 
# We must understand that each section contains one composable component since we already know Image, Text, Column, Row and Icon composables are related to the Color Class.
